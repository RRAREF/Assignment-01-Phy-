Physics of Light and Color
This repository contains two C programs that demonstrate the principles of light diffraction and color perception based on wavelength.

Assignment#1: Wavelength to Color Conversion
The first program calculates the wavelength of light in nanometers based on the distance between slits, the angle of the maximum, and the order of the maximum. It then determines the color of the light within the visible spectrum.
Compilation and Execution

Input
Distance between the slits (in micrometers)
Angle of the maximum (in degrees)
Order of the maximum
Output
The wavelength of the light (in nanometers)
The color of the light based on the calculated wavelength.
Assignment#2: Diffraction Angle Calculation
The second program calculates the diffraction angle for red light based on the known wavelength and diffraction angle for green light and the order of the maximum.

Compilation and Execution
Input
The program does not require any input as it uses predefined values for the calculations.

Output
The angle for the second-order bright spot for red light (in degrees)
Concepts Demonstrated
Light diffraction through slits
Wavelength calculation from diffraction patterns
Color perception based on wavelength within the visible spectrum.
